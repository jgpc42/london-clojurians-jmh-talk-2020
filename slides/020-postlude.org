* Final thoughts

** Tradeoffs

Not simple...

... because these modern VMs are not simple.

Lots of options.

Takes a bit of effort to learn and use properly.

** JVM

Doing this correctly on the JVM *is* more difficult.

Be prepared to do some spelunking.

Again, tradeoffs vs. static environment.

We should still strive for efficient, fast code. 

** JMH

Consider a gold-standard tool by which others are measured.

criterium and others are still very good.

JMH is not a panacea.

** Caveat

Your results may vary.
