* Tutorial

- Don't have time for complete tutorial.
- jmh-samples source and javadoc are great resources.

** Quick aside

Leiningen plugin to ease testing.

file:./project.clj
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defproject #_...
  :profiles
  {:dev {:plugins [[lein-jmh "0.2.8"]]}
   :jmh {:jvm-opts []}})
#+END_SRC

- For lein, make sure to clear its default JVM options.
- jmh-clojure can also be run via boot, or anything else.
