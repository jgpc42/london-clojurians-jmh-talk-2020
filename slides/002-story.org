* Background

I've done a lot of benchmarking in Clojure.

https://github.com/jgpc42/insn

** Should be simple, right?

Multiple buffer implementations:

- Raw byte arrays.
- Immutable chunks.
- etc.
- how do they perform relative to each other?

https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium

- The standard for Clojure.
- For my workload: consistently inconsistent results.

** Challenges on the JVM

- Problematic configuration?
- Hidden allocations?
- Unexpected outliers?
- Something else?

** Solution?

- Start a new JVM process for each benchmark. (?)
- Better (for the most part).

Still didn't feel very good about this...
