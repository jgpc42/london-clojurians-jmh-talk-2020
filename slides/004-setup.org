* Setup

** Example

- Not realistic.
- Just a demonstration.

** Environment

- Clojure 1.10.1
- criterium 0.4.6
- jmh-clojure 0.3.1 (uses JMH 1.23)
- 4 benchmarks, 10 full runs (40 results in total).

** Don't take my word for it

- Only 4 (representative) samples of the 40 runs.
- Full code and raw datasets will be available.
- Do compare with my results.

** Time constraints

- This took hours.
- Not going to run anything real time.
