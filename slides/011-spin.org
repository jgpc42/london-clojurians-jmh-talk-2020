* Modes

** Throughput

file:./02-modes.edn
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
{:benchmarks
 [{:fn demo.core/spin
   :options {:mode :throughput, :output-time-unit :seconds}}]}
#+END_SRC

file:src/demo/core.clj
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn spin []
  (-> TimeUnit (. MILLISECONDS) (.sleep 100)))
#+END_SRC

*** Run

$ lein jmh '{:file "./02-spin.edn", :fork 1, :only [:score]}'

{:score [9.306450777073717 "ops/s"]}

- Unsurprisingly, we get ~10 operations per second (ops/s).
- Quote about throughput mode:

"[it] measures the raw throughput by continuously calling the 
benchmark method in a time-bound iteration, and counting how 
many times it executed the method."

*** Notes
- Iteration = time slice.
- Period defaults to 10 seconds, with 5 iterations in total.
- Equal warmup iterations too.
- So a single run (fork) will take ~100 seconds.
- Easily altered to fit your workload.

** Average 

$ lein jmh '{#_... :mode :average}'

{:score [0.10741426425531915 "s/op"]}

- No need to change the edn file.
- As expected, our operation takes about 1/10 second 
  (seconds per operation: s/op).
- This is the mode used in the criterium comparison.

** Sample and single-shot

$ lein jmh '{#_... :mode [:single-shot, :sample], :only [:score :mode]}'

({:score [0.10909891895652175 "s/op"], :mode :sample} 
 {:score [0.1135973 "s/op"], :mode :single-shot})

- Single-shot is useful when developing benchmarks.
- For more on the these modes, see documentation.

** Convenience feature

$ lein jmh '{#_... :mode [:single-shot, :sample], 
             :format :table, :status true}'

:benchmark      :mode         :samples  :score       :score-error

  99.99%                      1         0.114  s/op
  100.0%                      1         0.114  s/op
demo.core/spin  :single-shot  1         0.106  s/op

- Special options like :format are provided by lein-jmh.
- Note: raw JMH output still available via :status option. 
- I hacked together this ASCII table support in an hour or so, 
  it's not the prettiest, but it works.
